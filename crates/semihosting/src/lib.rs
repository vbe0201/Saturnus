//! Semihosting for ARM Cortex-A processors.
//!
//! This is heavily inspired by the [`cortex-m-semihosting`] crate, but mainly intended to
//! be used in the specific environment Saturnus is tested in. Therefore, many features we
//! did not consider necessary to cover have been erased in this crate.
//!
//! # What is semihosting?
//!
//! "Semihosting is a mechanism that enables code running on an ARM target to communicate
//! and use the Input/Output facilities on a host computer that is running a debugger."
//!
//! - ARM
//!
//! # Interface
//!
//! This crate provides implementations of [`core::fmt::Write`], in conjunction with
//! [`core::format_args!`] or the [`core::write!`] macro for user-friendly construction and
//! printing of formatted strings.
//!
//! Since semihosting operations are modeled as [system calls][sc], this crate exposes an
//! untyped `syscall!` interface just like the [`sc`] crate does.
//!
//! # Forewarning
//!
//! Semihosting operations are *very* slow. Like, each WRITE operation can take hundreds of
//! milliseconds.
//!
//! # Reference
//!
//! For documentation about the semihosting operations, check:
//!
//! `Chapter 8 - Semihosting` of the ['ARM Compiler toolchain Version 5.0'][pdf] manual.
